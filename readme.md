# My Markdown Editor Project

### Author : [Mohit Paddhariya](https://github.com/dev-mohit06)

I am creating a markdown editor where users can:

- Write their markdown files and see a live preview
- The editor will automatically detect the language and highlight the syntax
- There will be a download button where users can directly download their .md file  
- Integrating AI capabilities:
  - Users can generate markdown content
  - The AI can help correct and improve the user's markdown files
